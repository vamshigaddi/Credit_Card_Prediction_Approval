# Credit Card Approval Prediction
## Introduction
The Credit Card Approval Prediction project aims to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or denied based on various applicant attributes and financial information.
## Project Overview
Credit card approval is a crucial process for financial institutions, involving the assessment of applicant data to determine creditworthiness. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can automate the credit card approval process, improving efficiency and accuracy.

## Model Description

The prediction model is built using several machine learning algorithms. The final model is selected based on performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RÂ² score. The main algorithms considered include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- SVM
- Random Forest

After extensive testing and validation, the best-performing model is chosen and fine-tuned for optimal performance.
